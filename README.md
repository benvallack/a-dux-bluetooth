Simplified versions of [tapioki](https://github.com/tapioki)'s [Architeuthis dux](https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux) with puck and TRRS removed, cutout adjusted, power switch and reset switch added. 

Board is reversable so controlles facedown on left and face up on the right. The power switch and reset switch should work on both sides too. 

CURRENTLY UNTESTED!
